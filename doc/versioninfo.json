  "versionNotes": "- **Breaking Change**: Logging into TraceBus has changed from raw style to ready-to-read style.\n- **Breaking Change**: TraceBusExceptionsTextualizedToggle was removed as it is now the default style\n- **New Feature**: Convenience Class \"ReturnCodeLogger\" to simplify the logging of return codes and status messages coming from function calls.\n- **New Feature**: Routing.TraceBusRawMode can be used to register TraceListener names which want to receive the raw style.\n- **Bug Fix**: TraceBusListener's Write() and WriteLine() did not do anything - no they invoke the same callback as TraceEvent() - using the hard coded defaults \"Dev\" as audience.\n"
